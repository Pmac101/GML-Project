<h2 id="time-sheet--lessons-learned">Time Sheet / Lessons Learned</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Week 1:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 hours</li>
<li>Began using GameMaker Studio 2 for the first time. I 	am new to both programming and GMS2 so there is a large amount of information for me to take in. It is a bit overwhelming, however, I am confident that everything will start to make more sense as I continue working on this project.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Week 2:</p>
<ul>
<li>3 hours</li>
<li>I have begun designing sprites(visual representations of objects) for my project. So far it has not been too difficult, but I realize this is more than likely the easiest part of my project. I have learned a lot of the basics regarding sprite design and I enjoy it so far.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Week 3</p>
<ul>
<li>3 hours</li>
<li>I finished designing the sprites and began working on the basic movement controls for the user sprite. This has been rather frustrating due to me not knowing the GMS2 language, GML, and being new to programming in general. GMS2 includes a wealth of information regarding its code, which has been helpful, but it has still been a lot of trial and error to get things working the way I want.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Week 4</p>
<ul>
<li>2 hours</li>
<li>I was able to finish programming the user sprite controls. Like I said before, it has been frustrating, however, it is rewarding to see my perseverance pay off. I am also starting to get a feel for GML syntax.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Week 5</p>
<ul>
<li>3 hours</li>
<li>Created collision masks for user sprite and asteroids. This step was easy and did not take as long as expected.</li>
<li>I also began working on the attack function for the user sprite. This was rather difficult to get working correctly, but after lots of trial and error I was able to succeed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Week 6</p>
<ul>
<li>2 hours</li>
<li>Fine tuned a few things regarding attack functions and collisions.</li>
<li>Began creating room environments (Start Menu, Game Over). Creating the actual text for the rooms was easy, however, getting the rooms to transition and function properly has been difficult.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Week 7</p>
<ul>
<li>3 hours</li>
<li>Finished code for room environments. Also implemented Score, Lives, and Events functions, which was rather easy compared to creating the room environments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Week 8</p>
<ul>
<li>2 hours</li>
<li>Adjusted asteroid spawn rate and randomization. This has been a little tricky, but it does function properly. I may end up lowering the spawn rate because I feel like there are almost too many asteroids once they break into smaller pieces after being shot.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Week 9</p>
<ul>
<li>2 hours</li>
<li>Sound effects were added to the game. This was an easy task. The hardest part was simply deciding which sound effects to use.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
